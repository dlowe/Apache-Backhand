Stuff that may make it into future versions (patches welcome!)
 . example replacement for backhand-handler
 . examples of byPerl functions
 . ability to pass arguments into byPerl functions (limited by the want23
   prototype of BackhandFromSO, unfortunately...)
 . serverstat items hostname and contact should be magically mirrored into
   perl like all the others
